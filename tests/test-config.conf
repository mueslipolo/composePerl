# Test Configuration
# ===================
# Controls which modules to skip during testing and how to run tests
#
# Format:
#   [ModuleName]
#   skip_load = yes|no          # Skip in module-load-test.pl (quick smoke test)
#   skip_test = yes|no          # Skip in test-suite-runner.pl (full CPAN tests)
#   reason = text               # Why this module is being skipped
#   env.VAR_NAME = value        # Set environment variable before running tests
#   test_command = command      # Custom test command (overrides default cpanm)
#
# Examples:
#   [Some::Module]
#   skip_load = yes
#   skip_test = yes
#   reason = Build-time only dependency
#
#   [DBD::Oracle]
#   skip_test = no
#   env.ORACLE_HOME = /opt/oracle/instantclient
#   env.LD_LIBRARY_PATH = /opt/oracle/instantclient
#   reason = Requires Oracle environment variables
#
#   [Problem::Module]
#   skip_test = yes
#   test_command = prove -l t/specific_test.t
#   reason = Some tests fail, but specific tests work

[Devel::CheckLib]
skip_load = yes
skip_test = no
reason = Build-time only dependency, not needed at runtime

[Mixin::Linewise]
skip_load = yes
skip_test = no
reason = Not required at runtime

[Apache::LogFormat::Compiler]
skip_test = yes
reason = Fails on some timezone test (problem to solve!)
